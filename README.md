## CoordiMapper

This script was created on May 6th by Uriel Garcilazo for Mathstronauts: [Spike] Get Lat/Long Given School Name  

The program's main and only module — coordiMapper — contains a function coordiMapper(), which receives as input:

```
'St. Joan of Arc Catholic High School'
```

and returns a record with the latitude and longitude:

```
(43.7380996, -79.2585026)
```

The program comes with a control module main.py that demonstrates its use with a list of schools, parsed through different formats and including json, .txt and .csv"# coordiMapper"
